A feeling familiar to you, but unplaceable. You stand in Father's attic. It's been hard since he passed, but you feel it upon you to look through his old possessions to take with you. 

The floorboards, a jagged array of wood far decayed, pierce the soles of your feet. Cobwebs drape over the edges of [[cardboard boxes]], and hang in meticulous arrangement from the [[weathered bookshelf in the corner]].

Itâ€™s hard to imagine anything has ever been touched.]

Trophies; Most Valuable Player 1986, Fairest Player 1986, a Championship medal. Accolades from Father's heyday. Nobody could pitch like him. It hurts to see them rot away like this. Perhaps you'll hang them up in the new house; it's what he would've wanted. 

You put the accolades away, and shift the boxes back into the corner. You see some of Father's old books nestled on (link: "the shelf")[(goto: "weathered bookshelf in the corner")weathered bookshelf in the corner].]

As you resume your gaze, you stare at Father's portrait frame; tears seem to drop from your eyes, but your face remains still.

You sit where you had always been, behind the hitter with a clear view of Father pitching. You could've sworn it happened on a hot day, but this time, you're hands sting with an numbing frost. As Father winds up to pitch, with the season on the line, the crowd extinguishes the tension with [[a gasp]]. ]
